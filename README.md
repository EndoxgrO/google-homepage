Finishing thoughts:

Definitely took longer than I had expected to make the divs behave the way I wanted them to in terms of "margin: 0 auto". 
Originally I had placed the content with absolute position but it fell apart when rezizing the screen. I'm sure there's a cleaner way to place everything rather than wrapping divs in divs in divs and auto margining everything down to their grandchildren but for now I'm ready to leave this alone.
